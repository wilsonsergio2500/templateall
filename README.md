<p>Create boilerplate or scafold code anytime and anywhere with ease</p>

## The Problem
Most often your project shares consistent boilearplate all across that you wish you could avoid re-doing and/or re-typing; and on other instances, cli can take you far but yet not far enough. **Templateall** is here for all of those other moments when the project structures feels really personal and you desired to bring about a lot of code without compelling amount of configuration.

Not only I have utilzed it with a tremendous degree of sucess, but fellow teammates have appreciate its simplicity and the increased tempo that it provides. Make it your own!

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm]. In order to scafold or create boilerplate  - from templates - globally install this package.

```
npm install templateall -g
```

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing <code>r</code>. You can quote an entire comment by clicking <span class="octicon octicon-kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" title="The horizontal kebab icon"></span>, then <strong>Quote reply</strong>.
