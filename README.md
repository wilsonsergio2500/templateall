<p>Create boilerplate or scafold code anytime and anywhere with ease</p>

## The Problem
Most often your project shares consistent boilearplate all across that you wish you could avoid re-doing and/or re-typing; and on other instances, cli can take you far but yet not far enough. **Templateall** is here for all of those other moments when the project structures feels really personal and you desired to bring about a lot of code without compelling amount of configuration.

Not only I have utilzed it with a tremendous degree of sucess, but fellow teammates have appreciate its simplicity and the increased tempo that it provides. Make it your own!

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm]. In order to scafold or create boilerplate  - from templates - globally install this package.

```
npm install templateall -g
```
## Prelude
In order stay consistent and provide ownership to the template creator and apply the least amount of configuration when running the module. The configuration file config.json and the templates must be under one common directory. 

<div style="border-color: #0366d6" class="extended-markdown tip border rounded-1 mb-4 p-3 border-blue bg-blue-light f5">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The package assumes that the configuration folder and the templates folder could be found at <strong><i>root\templateall.</i></strong> thus in a Windows machine <b><i>C:\templateall.</i></b> However, where the templates are actually locatec could be specified in the configuration file <b><i>config.json</i></b></p>
